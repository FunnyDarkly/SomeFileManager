There's a new File Manager 2.0: The upgrade nobody asked for! No, it's a Mediocre Manager: Because 'good enough' is sometimes just enough! Wait... is it Barely Better Files: Better than nothing, we promise! Ah, no matter, it's just SomeFileManager!

Quick start
Download, go to "build" folder, select .exe file aaaand exe... cute, like youðŸ˜Š

How to use
Add some files and sort them however you want! In future, tag system will be added, so you can add tags to files.
