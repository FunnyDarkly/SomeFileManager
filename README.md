There's a new **File Manager 2.0**: The upgrade nobody asked for! No, it's a **Mediocre Manager**: Because 'good enough' is sometimes just enough! Wait... is it **Barely Better Files**: Better than nothing, we promise! Ah, no matter, it's just **SomeFileManager**!

**Quick start**

Download, go to "build" folder, select .exe file aaaand exe... CUTE, like youðŸ˜Š

**How to use**

Add some files and sort them however you want! In the future, tag system will be added, so you can add tags to files.

UPD: Fellas, future has arrived and there's some tag system and other functionality, enjoy!
